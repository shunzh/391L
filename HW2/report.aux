The top 3 lines are reconstructed signals with $\eta = 0.01$ and 1000000 iterations. The results are scaled into $[0, 1]$ interval. This experiment is repeated twice. The results are in the figures shown above. The result can be permutation of the original sources. In the left figure, the mapping is 0-4, 1-5, 2-3.
