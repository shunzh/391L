In this report, I applied Independent Component Analysis on Blind Source
Separation problem.

\section{Experiment}

\subsection{Experiments on Small Set}

\caption{The bottom 3 lines are original signals from
\texttt{icaTest.mat}. The top 3 lines are reconstructed signals with $\eta
= 0.01$ and 1000000 iterations. Two independent experiments are shown.}
\label{fig:rep}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ | l l l l | }
\hline
& Recon. 1& Recon. 2& Recon. 3\\
Source 1&-0.4900& \textbf{0.9905}& -0.4248\\
Source 2&\textbf{0.9918}& -0.3957& -0.5454\\
Source 3&-0.4829& -0.5073& \textbf{0.9924}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Linear correlation between source and reconstructed signals, for
the left figure in Figure~\ref{fig:rep}. The maximum correlation is
highlighted.}
\label{tbl:corr1}
\end{table}

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ | l l l l | }
\hline
& Recon. 1& Recon. 2& Recon. 3\\
Source 1&-0.4248& \textbf{0.9905}&-0.4900\\
Source 2&-0.5454&-0.3957& \textbf{0.9918}\\
Source 3&\textbf{0.9924}&-0.5073&-0.4829\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Linear correlation between source and reconstructed signals, for
the right figure in Figure~\ref{fig:rep}. The maximum correlation is
highlighted.}
\label{tbl:corr2}
\end{table}

The results are scaled into $[0, 1]$ interval. This experiment is repeated
twice.  The results are in shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rep}. The result can be
permutation of the original sources. Scaling is also possible (as the
results are scaled into $[0, 1]$, the signal could be flipped in this
case). The correlation between source and reconstructed signals are shown in
Table~\ref{tbl:corr1} and \ref{tbl:corr2}. They are highly correlated if
the correlavance is close to $1$ or $-1$. We can tell in the left figure,
the mapping is 0-4, 1-5, 2-3. While in the right one, the mapping is 0-5,
1-3, 2-4. This result can be verified visually. We can also observe that
the algorithm overall generate highly close signal, with has more than
$0.99$ correlavance with its source signal.

\begin{figure}

\caption{$\Delta W$ over number of iterations. Average of 5 runs. The
length of vertical bars is $\sigma$ assmuing Gaussian distribution of data
points at each iteration.}
\label{fig:detW}
\end{figure}

I also examine how progress is made in each iteration in the learning
process. As the algorithm uses gradient descent, the update on $W$ each
step, which is $\Delta W$, is useful. For the convenience of visualization,
I need the magtitude of this matrix. I use the largest singular value here,
which can be got using \texttt{norm} function when applied to a matrix in
Matlab.

The result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:detW}. Not surprisingly, steps
become smaller after more iterations. The algorithm converges after $2
\times 10^5$ iterations.

\subsection{Experiments on Sound}

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ | l l l l l l | }
\hline
& Recon. 1& Recon. 2& Recon. 3& Recon. 4& Recon. 5\\
Source 1 &-0.0032& 0.0030&-0.0076&-0.0035& 1.0000\\
Source 2 &-0.0014&-0.0003& 0.9999&-0.0126& 0.0016\\
Source 3 &-0.0026&-0.0095& 0.0126& 0.9999& 0.0007\\
Source 4 &0.0020& 0.9999& 0.0083&-0.0102& 0.0041\\
Source 5 &0.9999& 0.0051& 0.0020& 0.0125&-0.0014\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Linear correlation between source and reconstructed signals.}
\label{tbl:corrsf}
\end{table}

Result on sound are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sound}. The correlation result
is shown in Table~\ref{tbl:corrs}. We can observe that the correlation is
smaller compared to that of experiment on small set.
